These are my solutions for first hundred problems of [Project Euler](https://www.projecteuler.net)

Project Euler problems are mainly mathematical problems along with some algorithmic problems that you mainly use your own math skills to solve them.

It may be useful for people who prepare for Iran National Olympiad Finals (3rd stage) and people wanted to start learning python.

I write these codes long time ago when I wanted to learn python so it maybe some not optimized implementation in my codes.

Don't hesitate to ask question if you have problems with solutions or codes.
You can find my email from my github profile.
